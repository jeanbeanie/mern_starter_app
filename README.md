# MERN Starter App

A seed starter app using Node (Express) and React (server side rendering) created to be used as the base for future projects and whatnot. So far successfully used to create my blog Im So Code (https://github.com/jeanbeanie/imsocode-blog-2)

Webpack/Babel (with hot reloading) is set up for development. Ava is included for test running.

#### Create your config file (see src/config.example.js), then just add water
> ```npm install```

> ```npm start``` 

#### Run tests
> ```npm test```

> ```npm watch```
