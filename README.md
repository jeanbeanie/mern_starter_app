# MERN Starter App

A seed starter app using Node (Express) and React (server side rendering) I created to be used as the base for future projects and whatnot.

Webpack/Babel (with hot reloading) is set up for development. Ava is included for test running.

#### Create your config file (see src/config.example.js), then just add water
> ```npm install``

> ```npm start``` 

#### Run tests
> ```npm test```

> ```npm watch```
